This project is a Visual Studio extension using the classic VSSDK approach. Write code accordingly.

Don't add comments to any code you add, however keep any existing comments you find.

All commands for building, testing, linting etc are maintained at the Makefile. They're configured to not emit much output unless they fail; that's normal. It may take up to 10 minutes without any output - wait patiently.

When you deem it necessary, run `make iter` which runs tests and linters related to the current set of Git changes.

When writing code, favor classes not surpassing 450 lines of code.
